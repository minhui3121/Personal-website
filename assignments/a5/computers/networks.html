<h1>Networks</h1>
<p><b>Definition:</b> A network consists of two or more separate devices (laptops, printers, servers, etc.) that are linked together so they can communicate. Each device on a network is called a node, and various nodes can be connected physically through cables or wirelessly through radio frequencies. Networks are useful for a variety of reasons but mainly for information sharing. Nodes on a network often share software, storage, data, and access to input or output devices which makes them more efficient and economical. Networks can be divided into two categories; local area network (LAN) limited for a specific area and wide area network (WAN) which are often comprised of multiple LANs that span on multiple locations.</p>
