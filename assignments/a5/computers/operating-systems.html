<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<p><b>Definition:</b> An operating system (OS), is a software program that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop computer, tablet, and smartphone includes an operating system that provides functionalities for the device. Desktop operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from a keyboard, sending output to a display screen, managing files and directories on a storage drive, and controlling peripheral devices like printers.</p>
