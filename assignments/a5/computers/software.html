<h1>Software</h1>
<p><b>Definition:</b> Software is a general term that describes computer programs and other operating information that computers use to function. Unlike hardware which exists physically, software is virtual consisting of lines of code written by programmers that have been compiled into a computer program. These instructions tell the hardware to perform specific tasks that is was designed for. Software programs are stored as binary data that is copied to a computer's hard drive.</p>
