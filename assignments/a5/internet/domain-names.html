<h1>Domain names</h1>
<p><b>Definition: </b>A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website. Each website has a domain name that serves as an address, which is used to access the website. Not all domain names are preceded by "www" prefix, however, all domain names have a domain suffix such as .com, .net, or .org. The domain suffix helps identifying the types of website. For example, ".com" domain names are typically used by commercial website, while ".org" websites are often used by non-profit organizations. Anyone can register a domain name and it is relatively cheap to register, but they must be renewed every year or every few years.  </p>
