<h1>Network bandwidth</h1>
<p><b>Definition: </b>In computer networking, bandwidth refers to the measurement of data that is transferred between two points within a set amount of time. Typically expressed in bits, megabits, or gigabits per second, bandwidth is shared among devices connected to the same network; this means activities like streaming video content or downloading large files can use a large amount of bandwidth and slow down connections for other devices on the network.  </p>
