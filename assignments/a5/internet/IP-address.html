<h1>IP address</h1>
<p><b>Definition: </b>An IP address, or simply an "IP," is a unique address that identifies a device on the Internet or a local network. Every computer that communicates over the Internet is assigned an IP address. It allows a system to be recognized by other systems connected via the Internet protocol. There are two primary types of IP address formats used today; IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 address consists of four sets of numbers from 0 to 255, separated by three dots (ex 67.43.14.98). An IPv6 address consists of eight sets of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons.</p>
