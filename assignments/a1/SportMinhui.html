<li><h2>What is <font color="#4B8A08"><i>baseball</i></font>?</h2></li>
<p>
<font size="5">Baseball is a sport where two teams of 9 players attack and defend alternatively with the objective of scoring more than the opposite team. Attacking team should hit with a bat the ball thrown by other team's pitcher and take as many bases as possible while defencing team should bring the ball before the hitter arrives at the base. If defending team manages to make three outs, their role changes. You can discover more about baseball in the link below.</font><br>

<li><h2><font color="#4B8A08"><i>Baseball</i></font> and me</h2></li>
<p>
<font size="5">It was my friends in elementary school who influenced me to like baseball. They were all passionate about it and I wanted to join their discussion. So I first watched a baseball game online when I was in first grade and it was awesome. Even though I hadn't completely understood the rules, it was fascinating to see how fast the ball travels from one person to another person. Since then, I've been playing baseball with my friends and watching plenty of games online and on stadium.</font>

<li><h2>I like <font color="#4B8A08"><i>baseball</i></font> because...</h2></li>
<p>
<font size="5"> There are plenty of reasons why I can't help but to like baseball. First, unlike many other sports, we get to see the ball flying with 150km/h every minutes. I really don't have time to get bored. Second, it is so interesting to see how two teams use different strategies such as stealing bass or a bunt to win. Last but not least, diving catches and home runs are more than enough to drive me crazy. It is so fun to talk about the game results and my analysis. </font>

<li><h2>My favourite <font color="#4B8A08"><i>baseball</i></font> team</h2></li>
<p>
<font size="5"> My favourite baseball team is called Sk Wyverns. Since I spent most of my childhood in South Korea, it's a team playing in Korean baseball league. I like this team because the players are all friendly and have good manners. Also, their home ground is located near the place where I used to live so I had many chances to watch their games. Although their results for 2020 aren't the best, this team will always remain as my favourite. The link below provides more information about the team. </font><br>

<li><h2>As a player</h2></li>
<p>
<font size="5"> Currently, I play baseball with my friends on Sundays. I usually play as a pitcher but since we are not professionals, there aren't any designated positions. While I'm playing, my head gets filled up with different thoughts; which type of pitch and where to throw. I feel excited when I manage to strike batters out. At this point, baseball has just become part of my life!</h2>
