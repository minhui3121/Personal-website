<li><p>In these days, playing <font color="#2E64FE">videogame</font> is a widely shared hobby between many people. They play using their computer, smartphone or games console. Personally, I play video games on my computer and smartphone. The game that I play the most is called League of Legends. <!--often refered as LoL for short form-->It's a 5 vs 5 multiplayer online battle game and the goal is to distroy opponents' towers. More about this game can be found in the link below. <br>

<li><p>I like to play <font color="#2E64FE">videogames</font> as my hobby mainly because it's fun to play. Making strategies and thinking of how can I improve my skill is just something I like to do. Also, since most videogames allow several people to play at the same time, it's a good way to hangout with friends without actually meeting each others. Finally, playing videogame sometimes helps me to refresh myself when I'm having hard time.
</p></li>
<li><p>Although I really enjoy playing <font color="#2E64FE">videogames</font>, it is a hobby that I need to be careful of. Excessive playing can be bad for my eyes and wrists, farthermore, my health in general. I also need to ensure that I've finished all my work before I play since I might forget to do something and it is challenging to concentrate right after playing videogames.
