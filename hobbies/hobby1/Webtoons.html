Originated from South Korea, it is now being translated into many different languages. There are many types of genres, starting from comedy to action, romance, or even sports.

<li><p>I read <font color="#04B404">Webtoons</font> using an application from the company "Naver". Most of the pieces are being uploaded once a week. My favorite comic is called "<i>Wind breaker</i>"<!--My direct translation from Korean-->. It talks about teenagers who grew up in different environment but had same passion on bicking. They somehow made a bicycle crew together and pursue their goal into professional level. I read webtoons mainly for fun, but some of them also give me useful life advices. They also make me relaxed by dragging me into the world of fictions.
