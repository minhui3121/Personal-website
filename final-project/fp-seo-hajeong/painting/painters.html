<div align="center"><h2><a name="monet">Claude Monet</a></h2>
    <img src="images/impressionism.jpg">
    <p>  This painting is called the <i>Sunrise,</i> painted in 1872. It is depicting a Le Havre port landscape </p>
    <p> He is the founder of the artistic movement called the impressionism. </p>
    <p> Impressionism is characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible bruhs storkes. It emphasizes the accurate depiction of light</p>
    <p> Claude Monet is my favourite painter, and I often try to do impressionism in my paintings</p>
